Description: 
-------------------
This is a personal project of mine in progress. Over the summer of 2024 between my freshman and sophomore year of college, I was inspired by a dream where I coded a Pokémon game to actually code a text-based Pokémon game with features like enemies of different types, elemental attacks, level progression, etc. There are no compile or run commands yet (as of the time of writing this) because it's still in progress and not ready for compiling.

As of September 2025, I've now completed the game loop and functionality for battling. The game runs well, besides fully implementing features like well-paced scaling for enemies and leveling. I added features like a decision tree and blackboard for enemy decision making. 

I coded, compiled, ran, and tested this using the environment IntelliJ IDEA Educational Edition 2022.2.2.
